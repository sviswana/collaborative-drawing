collaborative-drawing
=====================
Collaborative whiteboard that allows multiple users to draw at the same time across a network.

--


To start the server, run WhiteboardServer.java. The port is hard coded to 4444.

To start the client, you run Canvas.java. You will first be asked to the enter the IP address that the server is running on. (Please note, if a nonexistent IP address is entered, the user will be asked to enter again; checking for a valid IP address does take some time, so there may be delay when the dialog box pops up again).

Then you will be asked to enter a username. The username must be unique and valid. Once the canvas appears, either select "Create a New Whiteboard" or open one of the current whiteboards on the 
server by selecting a board within the "Available Boards" table. You can also switch between boards the same way.

To leave the program, you can click Logout or click the close button ("X") on the frame, which will end your session.

Enjoy!
